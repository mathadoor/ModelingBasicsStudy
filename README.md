# Modeling Basics Study
A repository containing code to supplement my blog posts related to bias variance tradeoff.
### General Structure
The general structure of the repository is as follows:  
`ModelingBasicsStudy/`  
&emsp;├── `CoinToss` contains the code for the coin toss experiment  
&emsp;├&emsp;├── `data_gen.py` code to generate the data   
&emsp;├&emsp;├── `main.py` code to run the experiments  
&emsp;├&emsp;└── `models.py` code to create models  
&emsp;├── `Plots` contains the plots generated by the code  
&emsp;└── `readme.md` contains general information regarding the project   

### Setup 
#### Step 1 - Install Conda Environment
If you haven't already, please make sure to download and install anaconda from the [official website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
#### Step 2 - Setup Conda Environment
Open a terminal/Command Prompt and create a conda environment by running the following command  
```commandline
conda create --name modeling python=3.8
```
#### Step 3 - Activate the environment
Activate the environment using the following command
```commandline
conda activate modeling
```
#### Step 4 - Install Numpy and Matplotlib
```commandline
conda install numpy
conda install matplotlib
```
### Running Experiments
#### Step 1 - Navigate to the CoinToss directory
```commandline
cd "ModelingBasicsStudy/CoinToss"
```
#### Step 2 - Update the parameters in `main.py` to your liking
```python
# Parameters
P = 0.7  # Probability of getting a head
DELTA = 0.1  # Difference in probability of getting a head when the coin is facing heads up and tails up
NUM_FLIPS_RANGE = np.arange(10, 100, 10)  # Number of coin tosses per experiment
NUM_TRIALS = 100  # Number of experiments
FIG_SIZE = (5, 5)  # Size of the figure
```
#### Step 3 - Run the experiment
```commandline
python main.py
```
#### Step 4 - View the Plots
The plots will be saved in the `plots` directory.
